# Card Master

Card Master is an iOS application. It's a party game that prompts players to take sips of their drink and is intended to be played at social events. It also incorporates classic party games such as "Never Have I Ever" and "Most Likely To". Please play responsibly.

This app was going to be published to the Apple App Store in the summer of 2020, however due to changes in policy around drinking apps, this was unfortunately not possible. I had considered repurposing the app with ice breaker prompts, however I ran out of time before the start of my final year of university.

The app can be loaded onto your iPhone via XCode.
